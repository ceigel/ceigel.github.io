Long time ago, I was doing a repetitive task. Changing file names or something similar. I don't quite remember. My friend saw this and asked "Why don't you just write a computer program. You are a programmer, aren't you?". Sure enough I was a programmer, but this was a task to small to spend time writing a whole C# or C++ program. There was all this compiling and I didn't know how to use the libraries to change all these file names.

I always knew that a programmer was supposed to know at least one scripting language. Often times I found myself needing to process a simple tab separated file, or running a program multiple times to measure its performance. I tried a few times to learn Perl, but it felt way to complicated. Then one day I found Ruby and after a while I fell in love with it. Everything felt so simple in Ruby. Finally the computer doesn't bug me to write parenthesis after each function call or add semicolon everywhere.

### Why do I love Ruby?

Recently I realized I didn't even know how a for loop is written in Ruby. That because I mostly never needed one. There is the each method on every enumeration class and most of the times when I want to process a data structure, chaining a few _map_ and _select_ would do the trick.
